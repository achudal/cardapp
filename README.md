## Overview
sprint-2
**Project Title**: learning Flashcard App

**Project Description**:This is a simple flashcard application designed to help users learn and review vocabulary. The app displays words in one language (e.g., French) and allows users to flip the cards to reveal their translations (e.g., English). Users can mark words they have mastered, and the app will track progress by saving known words to a CSV file, so they no longer appear in future reviews. The app uses Pythonâ€™s Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Pandas for managing data (CSV).

**Project Goals**:To create a functional flashcard app that can load, display, and review vocabulary.
To implement a progress tracker that saves known words to a CSV file.
To enhance the user interface with simple visual effects for a better learning experience.
To develop proficiency in using Python, Tkinter, and Pandas.


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install Python
2. Install pandas
3. Install tkinter
4. make sure you have csv file

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the application by executing the main Python file.
2.The flashcard will show a word in French (or another language) on the front.


## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Pandas version 1.x+
* python version 3.x+
* Tkinter

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Tkinter] (Lhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
* [GUI programming] (https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/)
* [Stack overflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Improve data handling to support multiple languages and larger datasets.
* [ ] Add more interactive features like quizzes or timed challenges.
* [ ] Optimize the UI for mobile devices and different screen sizes.
